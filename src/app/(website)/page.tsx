                Open Source Day is an international conference dedicated to open-source solutions, scheduled
                for March, in Florence, Italy. The event aims to introduce open-source technologies to public
                and business institutions, promoting them as secure, efficient, and cost-effective
                alternatives to proprietary software.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attendees, including managers, developers, and technical officers from various industries,
                will have the opportunity to exchange experiences and explore use cases in areas such as
                virtualization, cloud computing, databases, big data, and information security.
              </p>
              <p>
                The conference serves as a platform for fostering local communities and encouraging the
                development of small businesses that provide support and development for open-source
                solutions.

                ImageGoNord is a SaaS tool designed to convert RGB images into color palettes inspired by the
                NordTheme and other themes like Gruvbox. The NordTheme is a well-known color palette
                originally created for coding environments. It focuses on subtle, cool tones like blue, grey,
                and white, offering a minimalist and visually cohesive aesthetic that prioritizes readability
                and reduces visual fatigue.
              </p>
              <p>
                ImageGoNord allows users to upload images or videos and apply these palettes to create
                customized wallpapers, visuals, or design elements. The tool offers flexibility for users to
                refine the output to match their preferences while maintaining the selected theme&apos;s
                characteristics.
